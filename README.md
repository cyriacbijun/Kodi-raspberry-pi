# Install Netflix, Hotstar, Jio TV on raspberry pi with KODI

I can't think of anything more versatile than a raspberry pi. 
Are you a Tech enthusiast who has a spare Raspberry pi laying around just because you do not like the latest do-it-yourself or instructable?
Well, thankfully I am here to show you alternate "entertainment" powerhouse cabality of the raspberry pi. All this made possible by:
- Kodi[https://kodi.tv/]
- LibreElec[https://libreelec.tv/]
